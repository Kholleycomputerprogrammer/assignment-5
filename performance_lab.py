Time and Space Analysis for problem 1:
- Best case: O(n) → we always need to count all elements.
- Worst case: O(n) → still must check every element.
- Average case: O(n).
- Space complexity: O(k), where k = number of unique elements.
- Why this approach? Counter is simple and efficient.
- Could it be optimized? Yes, by tracking counts manually to avoid extra pass.

Optimization Notes:
- Original: used Counter + max() → two steps.
